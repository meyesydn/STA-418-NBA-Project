# NBA Analytics

Simple overview of use/purpose: Analyze the NBA advanced stats at hand, run some simulations, run different types of clustering algorithm, look into 
correlations. I want to see what factors impact the win/loss columns through visualization techniques and timeseries analysis, which attributes are the most related winning and run machine learning algorithms to ultimately figure out the contenders for the following season. 

## Description

Indepth Overview: I've been a sports junky all my life. I grew up in East Africa playing soccer and once I moved to the U.S my love for soccer shifted to basketball. It was a big disapointment when I moved here and realized that soccer wasn't as big of a sport in the country compared to the east side of the world. That combined with the fact that club soccer was always very expensive resulted in me shifting away from the sports and paying more attention of the NBA. In middle school and high school I joined the track and cross country teams, I did acceptionally well and got recruited to run at Grand Valley. I say all of this to say sports are in my DNA. As the NBA finals come to an end I wanted to do a project that analyzes this league. I want to visualize how the NBA has changed for the last couple decades and possibly figure out where it's headed. Sports nerds always talk about how the Golden State Warriors changed the NBA for over the past decade with their high volume 3-point shooting. Well, I want to see how they did it in depth. People always say its a copt-cat league so I also want to see if other franchises are changing their styles to mimic the Warriors. By the way, the warriors just won the NBA finals last Thursday, their 4th championship in the last 8 years. My goal through this analysis is to have a good understanding of how teams end their regular season and how big of impact that has once the playoffs begin. Do the top 2, 3 or 4 regular season teams almost always win the finals? maybe with some simulations we can get and idea of how often this is likely to happen. 

## Getting Started

Given that I was to make this project my own, I used the basketball-reference website to webscrape the advance stats table from 1992-2022. 30 seasons of data seems enough to accomplish what I want to do. The advance stats are not your basic stat lines you see at the end of a game, such as rebounds, assists, points..etc. These measurements only show the results of every play but not how the play was developed. The advance stats allow us to measure the impact of every team or player beyond the end result of every play. They measure the effiency of teams and players. 

### Dependencies/Prerequisites

The dataset has more than 30 columns. I've made a document that explains/defines each column and whether it needs to be kept or dropped. To get an understanding of the terminology of each advance stat it is important to go over this document.
