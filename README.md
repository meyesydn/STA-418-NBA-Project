# NBA Analytics

Simple overview of use/purpose: Analyze the NBA advanced stats at hand, run some simulations, run different types of clustering algorithm, look into 
correlations. I want to see what factors impact the win/loss columns and run machine learning algorithms to ultimately figure out the contenders for the following season. 

## Description

Indepth Overview: I've been a sports junky all my life. I grew up in East Africa playing soccer and once I moved to the U.S my love for soccer shifted to basketball. It was a big disapointment when I moved here and realized that soccer wasn't as big of a sport in the country compared to the east side of the world.

As the NBA finals come to an end I wanted to do a project that analyzes this league. I want to visualize how the NBA has changed for the last couple decades and possibly figure out where it's headed. Sports nerds always talk about how the Golden State Warriors changed the NBA for over the past decade with their high volume 3-point shooting. Well, I want to see how they did it in depth. People always say its a copt-cat league so I also want to see if other franchises are changing their styles to mimic the Warriors. By the way, the warriors just won the NBA finals last Thursday, their 4th championship in the last 8 years. My goal through this analysis is to have a good understanding of how teams end their regular season and how big of impact that has once the playoffs begin. Do the top 2 or 3 or 4 regular season teams always
